A blog extension for TYPO3 built entirely on core concepts — pages as posts, content elements for
article bodies, and categories/tags for organization. If you know TYPO3, you already know how to
use this blog.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes for TYPO3 v14

### Blog page templates: new plugin rendering approach

The `renderPlugin` section in the shipped blog page templates has changed.
This affects both the legacy integration templates under `Templates/Page/*.html`
and the TYPO3 v14 `PAGEVIEW` templates under `Templates/Pages/*.fluid.html`.

**New (v14-compatible, workspace-safe):**

```html
<f:section name="renderPlugin">
    <f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath="tt_content.{listType}.20" />
</f:section>
```

**Why:** TYPO3 v14 added the `record-transformation` data processor to
`lib.contentElement`. It requires all system fields (`sys_language_uid`,
`l18n_parent`, `t3ver_wsid`, `header`, …) on every `tt_content` row. The old
approach rendered synthetic `tt_content` rows that lacked these fields, causing
`IncompleteRecordException`. The new approach renders the `EXTBASEPLUGIN`
content object directly, bypassing the content-element pipeline entirely.

**Action required:** If your sitepackage overrides `BlogList` / `BlogPost`
templates in either `Page/*.html` or `Pages/*.fluid.html` (including the
`ModernTailwind` / `ModernBootstrap` variants), update the `renderPlugin`
section to use the new pattern shown above.

For TYPO3 v14 standalone rendering, the recommended templates are the
`PAGEVIEW` files in `Resources/Private/Templates/Pages/*.fluid.html` together
with `Resources/Private/Templates/Layouts/Pages/Default.fluid.html`.

**Removal:** The legacy synthetic `tt_content` rendering pattern is no longer
part of the supported rendering path. Template overrides still using that
approach must be updated to `tt_content.{listType}.20`.
